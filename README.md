# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### How i create this app ?

This app is created by using AI, React and Cursor IDE.
Test app to check the AI and React.
This simple app demonstrates the integration of AI within a React application. The primary goal is to showcase how AI can be utilized to enhance user experience and provide dynamic content generation. The app leverages an AI model to generate text based on user input, offering a glimpse into the potential of AI-driven applications.

Key Features:

- AI-powered text generation: Users can input a prompt, and the app will use an AI model to generate and display text based on that prompt.
- React-based UI: The app is built using React, showcasing how AI functionalities can be integrated within a React application seamlessly.

How to Use:

1. Enter a prompt in the provided text field.
2. Click on the "Generate" button.
3. The app will process your input and display the AI-generated text below the button.

This app serves as a basic example of combining AI with React, illustrating the possibilities of enhancing web applications with AI capabilities.
